### 🚀 Features

1. 🤖 AI-Powered Chat Assistant with Smart Task Classification
Your built-in assistant intelligently classifies user inputs into medical, general, or doctor-related reminders.
This enables automated, personalized scheduling — improving adherence to medications, checkups, or general health routines.

2. 📊 Automated Health Report Analysis with Graph Generation
The system scans uploaded reports (e.g., lab results) and generates visual graphs to show trends like sugar levels or BP.
Empowers patients and doctors to monitor health progression visually and make timely decisions.

3. 📅 Doctor Appointment Booking with EHR Integration
Patients can book appointments that are directly tied to their EHR, ensuring doctors have complete context.
Reduces redundant data entry and improves consultation efficiency.

4 📁 *Comprehensive & Secure Electronic Health Record (EHR) Management*
MediSphere securely stores a patient’s complete medical history—including past diagnoses, surgeries, prescriptions, and vaccination records—with *role-based access control* and *end-to-end encryption*. This ensures safe, centralized access to critical health data for patients, doctors, and authorized staff, enabling seamless care coordination and long-term health tracking.

5 🚑 *Integrated Healthcare Services: Pharmacy, Emergency SOS & Lab Booking*
MediSphere offers a unified services module where users can *book medicines* from nearby pharmacies, *trigger one-tap SOS alerts* to locate the nearest hospital and dispatch an ambulance, and *schedule lab tests with home sample collection*. These features enhance accessibility, speed, and convenience—especially for rural and elderly users—bringing critical healthcare support directly to their fingertips.

### 🛠️ Future Improvements

2. Implement AI-based appointment suggestions
3. Enable video consultations through WebRTC
4. Add SMS and email appointment notifications
